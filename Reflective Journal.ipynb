    "Last semester, my group and I worked on the Melbourne housing data project. Initially, we struggled with some members being absent on the first week, but those of us present remained committed and worked collaboratively to narrow our focus and outline some research questions. Our primary challenge was, surprisingly, not in this part but in the presentation time. We needed to trim out our presentation from an initial 25 minutes to the required 10 minutes. Through continuous revisions and feedback, we eventually achieved a polished, rehearsed 13-minute presentation and prepared a good poster for the session. I felt a sense of pride in the final result. The initial absenteeism was disheartening, but our group's dedication was inspiring (accidental rhyme). The whole process of refining our presentation was challenging yet rewarding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project turned out well. Our teamwork and dedication allowed us to overcome initial setbacks and produce a high-quality presentation and poster. However, this experience highlighted the importance of consistent attendance and early time management to avoid last-minute rushes. The key success factors were effective communication and collaborative problem-solving. We learned to give and receive constructive feedback, which significantly improved our presentation. However, our initial lack of attendance and time management led to unnecessary stress and could have jeopardized our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, In future projects, establishing clear attendance expectations and starting with a more structured timeline would mitigate the risk of falling behind and ensure that everyone contributes effectively from the beginning. To improve, I will propose setting regular meeting times and clearly defined roles for the project. "

    "In Week 2, we formed teams to start a new project on sales forecasting for Rossmann stores. Our initial discussions were productive, with everyone present and contributing valuable ideas. We outlined a somewhat clear direction for our project and began preliminary data cleaning. Each member was then tasked with understanding the project scope to prepare for coding in Week 3. Unfortunately, in Week 3, both I and another team member fell ill and were unable to attend the sessions, which was disheartening. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our momentum was disrupted, missing out on crucial discussions and initial coding sessions left me feeling anxious and concerned about catching up. The illness highlighted the fragility of our group dynamics when members are absent. It underscored the importance of contingency plans and effective communication to ensure that everyone stays on track, even when unexpected events occur. This problem is thankfully minimized due to the structure where we could be given task to do in our own time, hence even missing members could contribute to the project. Additionally, assigning backup roles or creating more detailed documentation could help mitigate the impact of unexpected absences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, I will suggest setting up a shared online space for real-time updates and progress tracking. At the moment of writing this reflection, the shared online space has been established; however, progress tracking hasn't been implemented. This will allow those who are absent to stay informed and contribute as much as possible from afar. I will also make a concerted effort to catch up on the missed work from Week 3 by coordinating with my team members and reviewing any notes or recordings from the sessions I missed."

    "Over the past couple of weeks, our project hit a bit of a snag. We had reached out to our supervisor through our group chat to check if our research questions were on the right track, but we didn’t hear back for quite a while. I was really worried that our questions might not be up to standard, and that we’d have to start over from scratch, which could really throw our timeline off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the initiative, I reached out to our supervisor privately to clear up our uncertainties. Thankfully, I got the green light on our questions, which was a huge relief! It felt great to know we were headed in the right direction and didn’t need to rethink our entire approach. Honestly, I feel pretty fortunate with our topic. I've heard from some friends in other groups who are having a tougher time, so knowing we're on solid ground has been reassuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for our team’s progress, each of us is tackling a different research question. I’ve wrapped up my part, but some of my teammates are still working through theirs, juggling other assignments at the same time. Once everyone is content with their sections, we’ll dive into developing the predictive algorithm. I’m particularly excited about this part since I’ve applied my studies in marketing/business to this project. Working on predictive algorithms seems like something I might do often in my future career, so this experience is incredibly relevant and engaging. I’m really looking forward to seeing how all our individual efforts will come together in this next phase."

    "For this week's research journal, I'll delve into my evolving role within our group, which has seen some shifts over the semester. Initially, my role centered on contributing one of the research questions and preparing the initial data analyses, which I managed to complete efficiently. However, as the semester progressed and we approached the final stages of our project and other member have finished their part, we decided to move on and focus on the presentation and report.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Week 7, during one of our review sessions, my teammates suggested I take a different approach to my research question. This feedback was pivotal, and I agreed as I believe that there is more to gain from my research. As we moved into preparing for our final presentation, we decided to further distribute tasks more explicitly, especially regarding the report/journal that we have to write, focusing on the organization of this report to write our findings in a cohesive manner. We planned a review and discussion on what each of us wish to present before the mock presentation on week 9, aiming to refine our delivery and ensure a seamless transition between segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with these challenges required open communication and a willingness to accept constructive criticism. I've found that being open to feedback and ready to adjust my approach has not only enhanced our project but also contributed to my personal growth. Moving forward, our focus is on delivering a polished and well-coordinated presentation that reflects the hard work and collaboration of our entire team."
